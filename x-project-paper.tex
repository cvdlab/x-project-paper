\section{Introduction}

A web application framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic web applications.
To speed up web application development, action based frameworks mostly rely on external configuration files
Regarding to numerous open source web frameworks, it becomes so difficult for developers to select a suitable framework for web applications development. Because of that, the purpose of this paper is to help web developers to easier choose the right framework for development of their web applications. The paper will analyze a few open source Java component based frameworks. Additionally, the paper will provide basic features of the analyzed frameworks as well as represent their most important characteristics. Also, in this paper the analyzed web frameworks will be compared and summarized [1, 2, 3].

\section{State of the art}

Web  è una collezione di standard all'avanguardia che ci fornisce la possibilità di creare widget, è totalmente riusabile e non interferisce con il funzionamento della pagina in caso di cambiamento dell'implementazione interna del componente.
Nello sviluppo di un widget è importante utilizzare abilmente Javascript e HTML per la visualizzazione dinamica dei contenuti e gli standard di Web Components sono orientati verso ciò. L'unico, fondamentale, problema relativo allo sviluppo di Web Components è dettato dal DOM. Il DOM interno a un widget non è incapsulato dal resto della pagina. Questa mancanza potrebbe portare a problemi di sovrascritture da parte della pagina su elementi all'interno del widget.
Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.[21] Open-source software is developed in a collaborative public manner. Open-source software is the most prominent example of open-source development and often compared to (technically defined) user-generated content or (legally defined) open-content movements.[22]

\subsection{Web Application and CMS platforms}

One universal definition of Content Management System is: ``A system that lets you apply management principles to content''[4].
WordPress is a free and open-source CMS based on PHP and MySQL. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system [5]. WordPress was used by more than 23.3% of the top 10 million websites as of January 2015 [6]. WordPress is the most popular blogging system in use on the Web, at more than 60 million websites [7, 8].
Keystone.js is a Node.js CMS and Web Application Platform. It is an open source framework for developing database-driven websites, applications and APIs in Node.js. It is built on Express and MongoDB [9].
The LoopBack framework is a set of Node.js modules that you can use independently or together.  
An application interacts with data sources through the LoopBack model API, available locally within Node.js, remotely over REST, and via native client APIs for iOS, Android, and HTML5. Using these APIs, apps can query databases, store data, upload files, send emails, create push notifications, register users, and perform other actions provided by data sources and services.
Clients can call LoopBack APIs directly using Strong Remoting, a pluggable transport layer that enables you to provide backend APIs over REST, WebSockets, and other transports.
The following diagram illustrates key LoopBack modules, how they are related, and their dependencies. [10]

\subsection{Single Page Applications}

A single-page application (SPA), is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience akin to a desktop application. In an SPA, either all necessary code - HTML, JavaScript, and CSS - is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although modern web technologies (such as those included in the HTML5 pushState() API) can provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.

\section{Next generation technologies and frameworks}

\subsection{WebComponents}

Web Components are a collection of standards which are working their way through the W3C and landing in browsers as we speak. In a nutshell, they allow us to bundle markup and styles into custom HTML elements. What's truly amazing about these new elements is that they fully encapsulate all of their HTML and CSS. That means the styles that you write always render as you intended, and your HTML is safe from the prying eyes of external JavaScript. [11]

  \item[Custom Elements] This specification describes the method for enabling the author to define and use new types of DOM elements in a document.
  \item[HTML Imports] HTML Imports are a way to include and reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents.
  \item[Templates] This specification describes a method for declaring inert DOM subtrees in HTML and manipulating them to instantiate document fragments with identical contents.
  \item[Shadow DOM] This specification describes a method of establishing and maintaining functional boundaries between DOM trees and how these trees interact with each other within a document, thus enabling better functional encapsulation within the DOM.
\end{description}

\subsection{Web Components Frameworks}

Web Components usher in a new era of web development based on encapsulated and interoperable custom elements that extend HTML itself.
There are three major frameworks built atop these new standards: Polymer, X-Tag and Bosonic.
Moreover there are some Web Application Frameworks that are moving their philosophy towards Web Components such as AngularJS [101, 200, 201] and EmberJS [102].
Polymer makes it easier and faster to create elements, from a button to a complete application across desktop, mobile, and beyond. The Polymer core provides a thin layer of API on top of web components. It expresses Polymer's opinion, provides the extra sugaring that all Polymer elements use, and is meant to help make developing web components much easier [103].
X-Tag allows to easily create elements to encapsulate common behavior or use existing custom elements to quickly get the behavior desired. X-Tag provides several powerful features that streamline element creation such as: custom events and delegation, mixins, accessors and component lifecycle functions [104].
Bosonic is a set of tools that enable the built and use reusable Web Components. By leveraging the power of DOM to build high-level elements, it allows to simplify application's code and benefits from 3rd-party elements [105].

\subsubsection{Components}

da Web services and web components
Component-based Software Engineering denotes the process of building software by (re)using pre-built software components. The main benefit of component-based software is the "time-to-market" [12], thus reducing the cost of developing the software. A software component is a unit of composition with contractually specified interfaces and explicit context dependencies. Additionally, a component is a software element that conforms to a component model and can be independently deployed and composed [13]. Component based software is developed interconnecting building blocks, therefore, a high degree of reusability and modularity is achieved by this type of applications [14].

\subsection{Architecture}

Client/Server API-centric architecture for Single Page Applications.

\subsubsection{Server-side}

\begin{description}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item[Node.js web framework] 
    Node.js è un framework event-driven per il motore JavaScript V8, su piattaforme UNIX like. Si tratta quindi di un framework relativo all'utilizzo server-side di Javascript.
  \item[MongDB]
    MongoDB è un database non relazionale, orientato ai documenti. Classificato come un database di tipo NoSQL, MongoDB si allontana dalla struttura tradizionale basata su tabelle dei database relazionali in favore di documenti in stile JSON con schema dinamico (MongoDB chiama il formato BSON), rendendo l'integrazione di dati di alcuni tipi di applicazioni più facile e veloce.
\item[NoSQL]
    NoSQL (often interpreted as Not only SQL[1][2]) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling, and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, graph, or document) differ from those used in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL and others faster in relational databases. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. 
  \item[Strongloop]
    StrongLoop offers a subscription-based product known as StrongLoop Suite. StrongLoop Suite includes three components: an open source private mobile Backend-as-a-Service mBaaS named LoopBack; a second component called StrongOps, which provides operations and real-time performance monitoring in a console; and a supported package of Node.js called StrongNode, containing advanced debugging, clustering and support for private npm registries.

\subsection{Model definition}

To speed up web application development, action based frameworks mostly rely on external configuration files and less on Java code [15]
avviene tramite JSON


CMS definito tramite modelli. Un modello è definito da un json, estensione dei models di loopback. Il generatore di API di loopback usa questi modelli. Hanno un campo type. Nell'estensione, per non entrare in conflitto con loopback, viene aggiunto un campo {\tt \$type}.
A ogni tipo di dato è associato un campo di input corrispondente. 
Tali type sono: 

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
       \item number: x-number
       \item string: x-input,
       \item select: x-select,
       \item date: x-date,
       \item enum: x-radio,
       \item number: x-number,
       \item email: x-email,
       \item textarea: x-textarea,
       \item url: x-url,
       \item boolean: x-checkbox,
       \item money: x-money,
       \item password: x-password
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}

The advantages of this approach ar

\subsection{Statistical comparison}

In the present time open source content management system (CMS) has gained a big market. Lots of varieties are available based on functionality and platform.
As told in there are different performance criteria like page load time (PLT), page size (PS), number of request, number of CSS and JS files etc. while comparing all these parameters we could come to conclusion that which CMS should be used under what conditions [19].

Generally all CMSs fulfill common task of content like create, edit, publish. But above mention CMS are providing good user support, security, more plug-ins, documentation etc than other.
 
As shown in [20] there are about thirty features to analyze to make a comparison of CMSs. We can design six important classes of features that summarize all the features.

Admin Management, Data Management, User Management, UI Management, Web Content Management, Multimedia Data Management.

\subsection{Security}

Third-party code inclusion is rampant, potentially exposing sensitive data to attackers. Protected Web components can keep private data safe from opportunistic attacks by hiding static data in the Document Object Model (DOM) and isolating sensitive interactive elements within a Web component.
The Web has evolved from including static images and document links to comprising Web applications with individual components provided by numerous service providers. When a Web application incorporates third-party components using remote scripts, the user's browser will run the third-party code within the security context of the Web application. This not only exposes the code's functionality to the Web application but also gives the included code full access to the Web application's client-side context, including the page's content, local data, and origin-protected functionality. 
This lack of code isolation can have severe consequences if the included code doesn't behave correctly.

Consequently, by including potentially untrusted remote scripts, a Web application developer accepts a certain risk, both for the site's integrity and for the safekeeping of user data [16].

Web components are the most viable starting point for creating a protection mechanism for private data and sensitive elements against opportunistic attackers. They offer the required flexibility to cope with the highly dynamic requirements of modern Web applications, as opposed to iframes, and already possess the capability to host a separate DOM tree using the shadow DOM, a property that is hard to achieve using JavaScript sandboxing technologies [17].

To leverage Web components to create protected Web components, we must be able to hide static data in the DOM tree, without it being accessible to opportunistic attackers. Second, protected Web components should be able to host interactive elements, without being vulnerable to script-based compromises-for example, through function-overriding or prototype-poisoning attacks [18].
